      unrepeated is a mini edition of eight objects—ranging from leather heels
      to glass plates, a dagger, and even skin—each engraved with the same motif.
      <br><br>
      I explore how different materials distort the pattern, giving rise to new forms.
      The edition brings together eight unique works, each revealing a version of the motif
      that drifts further or closer to the original, highlighting the dialogue between motif,
      material, and transformation.

inspired by worldisastercompilation.1 by Notinbed, this interactive visual project translates the music’s raw,
destructive energy into image.<br><br>
it begins in a calm, almost meditative landscape before interaction triggers a gradual collapse,
where real disaster footage, effects, and structures accumulate.<br><br>
the experience unfolds from stillness to total chaos,
echoing both human responsibility and uncontrollable forces behind global catastrophes.<br><br>
