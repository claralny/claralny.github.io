      unrepeated is a mini edition of eight objects, ranging from leather heels
      to glass plates, a dagger, and even skin, each engraved with the same motif.
      <br><br>
      I explore how different materials distort the pattern, giving rise to new forms.
      The edition brings together eight unique works, each revealing a version of the motif
      that drifts further or closer to the original, highlighting the dialogue between motif,
      material, and transformation.

experimental music video for angel candles by Notinbed 
& Clara Kimera.<br><br>

the visuals extend Notinbed’s graphic universe and take 
the song’s lyrics as a starting point. blending generative imagery and editing, the video seeks a visual translation 
of the sound, letting rhythm and textures guide the narrative.<br><br>
alongside the video, I developed fictional poster experiments for an Angel Candles release party, using tracing paper prints that layer visuals over text, extending the video’s imagery into textures.<br><br><br><br>

VR environment created in Blender, interpreting Ryoji Ikeda’s datamatics, which explores the relationship between data, sound, and image. his work uses raw data to generate geometric visuals and sounds, encouraging reflection on the data that surrounds 
us and how it might transform.<br><br>

I chose to situate the project in a familiar, data-filled environment : the subway. elements gradually transform in rhythm with the song datamatics. presenting it in VR immerses the audience 
in a direct and intense audiovisual experience.<br><br><br><br>
